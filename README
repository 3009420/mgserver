== Welcome to the Modular Game Server ==

This server is part of the effort to recreate a protocol-compatible server for 
the "Rumble in The Void" original game client. 
The original VR1 server software was never released to the public. Consequently
it was lost when the last game host (GOA) closed their Rumble servers and VR1 
went out of business. Even if the software was available, there is nobody left 
who has an working key or could issue one. So here we are.

Before I get into the details let me get something straight:
According to personal communication with former game developers from VR1, 
"Rumble in the Void" and any other Conductor games can safely be considered 
abandonware. Nontheless the copyright for the client software resides with whoever 
bought VR1. Therefore the main aim of this project is learning how to develop an 
efficient MMO game server. "Rumble in the Void" is chosen as a simple enough 
example of a client application. 

!!!
The developers do NOT support any kind of COMMERCIAL use of the software generated
by this project in conjunction with the VR1 Rumble in the Void game client. 
!!!

If anyone was to develop a free client though...

== System Requirements, Installation, etc ==

node.js (v0.4.1 tested and working) is required to run this server. Further requirements
may depend on the game modules

To test this software download the source from github, adjust the config files to
your liking, and run

node server.js

The RITV client version for testing is currently v2.50.f (20503). Different versions
may work as well.


== Current State and Future Plans ==

This section will be updated with more information as development proceeds.

24.02.2011:
The basic framework has been roughly slapped together and works so far.
It is possible to connect to the Auth server with the RITV client.
Arenas and descriptions are shown.
It is not yet possible to join games.

Modularity is on the way where I want to have it. But not there yet.
The mid-term goal is to be able to run multiple instances of the main server
in parallel (multiprocessing) or possibly on different machines, which can be 
transparently controlled from one master control instance. Each instance can run 
one or several modules. For example, the Auth server could run on one machine, 
the Rumble server on another, and the SARAC server on yet another and all could
be controlled from one of the machines. I am not completely sure how this will 
be accomplished, yet. But the client and the protocol definitely allow for this.
